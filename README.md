## About Me

I bring over a decade of experience in:
- **Teaching and Curriculum Design**: Developed and led machine learning and AI courses at Aalto University and beyond.
- **Educational Leadership**: Designed innovative pedagogical strategies to engage diverse audiences.
- **Mentorship and Coaching**: Guided academics and professionals in research, teaching, and leadership.

ðŸ“˜ Author of [*Machine Learning: The Basics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-8193-6)  
In my book, I break down machine learning methods from linear regression to deep reinforcement learning 
into three fundamental design choices: **data**, **model**, and **loss**. This structured approach provides 
readers with a clear framework for understanding and designing machine learning systems.

ðŸŽ¥ Creator of educational content on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@alexjung111)  
I have developed a YouTube channel featuring rich educational resources, including lecture 
recordings, scientific talks, master thesis presentations, and group meetings. My channel 
serves as a hub for sharing knowledge and fostering academic engagement.
